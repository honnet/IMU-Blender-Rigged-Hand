How to run this project.
-----------------------

1. Part One Arduino File
  Run the arduino script in Arduino folder, this script will read the flex sensor readings and publish them in pyserial port
  from where blender script will read the output.
2. Part Two blender python script
  Open the .blend file from blender folder in Blender software, it will have a python script which will read the values     published from the arduino file and will animate the hand.
